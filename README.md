Prop Drilling - Prop drilling, also known as "props drilling" or "parameter passing," is a term used in the context of component-based architectures, especially in frameworks like React. It refers to the process of passing data from a higher-level component down to one or more nested child components through props (properties).

In a component tree, where you have a hierarchy of parent and child components, if a piece of data is needed at a lower level of the hierarchy, you pass it down through each intermediate level of components. This can lead to a situation where props are passed through multiple levels of components, even if some of those intermediate components don't directly use the props themselves. This passing down of props through multiple layers is what is referred to as prop drilling.

Here's a simplified example in React:

```jsx
// GrandparentComponent.js
const GrandparentComponent = () => {
  const data = "Some data";

  return <ParentComponent data={data} />;
};

// ParentComponent.js
const ParentComponent = ({ data }) => {
  return <ChildComponent data={data} />;
};

// ChildComponent.js
const ChildComponent = ({ data }) => {
  return <p>{data}</p>;
};
```

In this example, `data` is passed down from `GrandparentComponent` to `ParentComponent`, and then from `ParentComponent` to `ChildComponent`. If you have more levels in your component tree or if the data needs to be passed to a deeply nested component, the process continues.

While prop drilling is a straightforward way to manage state in React, it can become cumbersome as your application grows, especially when you have many layers of components. In such cases, you might consider using other state management solutions like React Context, Redux, or Recoil to avoid excessive prop drilling and make the state more accessible to components that need it without passing it through every intermediate component.

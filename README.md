Prop Drilling - Prop drilling, also known as "props drilling" or "parameter passing," is a term used in the context of component-based architectures, especially in frameworks like React. It refers to the process of passing data from a higher-level component down to one or more nested child components through props (properties).

Here's a simplified example in React:
In the provided code, prop drilling occurs when data needs to be passed down through multiple layers of components. Let's identify the prop drilling in your code:

1. **Prop Drilling in Shop Component:**
   - **Prop:** `onAddItemToCart`
   - **Explanation:** The `onAddItemToCart` function is passed down as a prop from the `App` component to the `Shop` component. This function is then further passed down to the `Product` component.

2. **Prop Drilling in Product Component:**
   - **Prop:** `onAddToCart`
   - **Explanation:** The `onAddToCart` function is passed down as a prop from the `Shop` component to the `Product` component.

3. **Prop Drilling in Header Component:**
   - **Props:** `cart` and `onUpdateCartItemQuantity`
   - **Explanation:** Both `cart` and `onUpdateCartItemQuantity` are passed down as props from the `App` component to the `Header` component.

4. **Prop Drilling in CartModal Component:**
   - **Props:** `cartItems` and `onUpdateCartItemQuantity`
   - **Explanation:** Both `cartItems` and `onUpdateCartItemQuantity` are passed down as props from the `Header` component to the `CartModal` component.

5. **Prop Drilling in Cart Component:**
   - **Props:** `items` and `onUpdateItemQuantity`
   - **Explanation:** Both `items` and `onUpdateItemQuantity` are passed down as props from the `CartModal` component to the `Cart` component.

### Disadvantages of Prop Drilling:

1. **Complexity and Maintenance:**
   - Prop drilling can lead to complex and harder-to-maintain code, especially as the application grows. It becomes challenging to keep track of which component receives which props.

2. **Component Coupling:**
   - Prop drilling tightly couples components together, making it more difficult to reuse or refactor them independently. Changes in one component may require modifications in multiple other components.

3. **Readability:**
   - Reading and understanding the code can become more difficult, especially for developers who are not familiar with the entire component hierarchy. This can slow down development and increase the likelihood of introducing bugs.

4. **Performance Concerns:**
   - Passing down props through multiple layers can impact performance, although the impact is often negligible in smaller applications. However, in larger applications, optimizations such as using context or Redux might be more suitable.

To mitigate prop drilling, consider using React Context API or state management libraries like Redux to manage shared state in a more centralized and scalable way. This can help avoid passing props through many layers of components.

While prop drilling is a straightforward way to manage state in React, it can become cumbersome as your application grows, especially when you have many layers of components. In such cases, you might consider using other state management solutions like React Context, Redux, or Recoil to avoid excessive prop drilling and make the state more accessible to components that need it without passing it through every intermediate component.


# Component Composition 
Component composition is a design pattern in software development that involves building complex systems by combining and assembling smaller, reusable components. It is particularly relevant in the context of front-end development, such as building user interfaces in web applications.

Imagine you're building a tower using different Lego pieces. Each Lego piece represents a part of your website or app. Now, prop drilling is like passing around one specific Lego piece from the bottom to the very top of your tower, even if some parts in the middle don't really need it.

Component composition, on your Lego tower, means designing each piece so that it does its own job well and can be reused easily. It's like having separate Lego pieces for the roof, walls, and windows. Instead of passing the same Lego piece through every layer, you make sure each part only cares about what it needs. This makes your tower more organized and easier to change without affecting every level.

So, component composition is about making your code like well-designed Lego pieces, where each piece does its job, can be reused, and you don't have to pass the same piece through every level of your tower.
